To run the server, do

 cabal run

Some http requests you can make against the server...

You can get the list of switches like this (should return empty list on first time):
 curl localhost:3000/switches

You can add a switch by posting a switch object (in JSON format) to addswitch URL. The switch1.json and switch2.json files have two example switches inside:

 curl -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d @switch1.json localhost:3000/addswitch
 curl -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d @switch2.json localhost:3000/addswitch

You can delete a switch by doing a DELETE HTTP request to the switch URL; I.e. to delete switch with ID 666, do:

 curl -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X DELETE localhost:3000/switch/666
